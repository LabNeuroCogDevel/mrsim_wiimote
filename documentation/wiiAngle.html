<H2> Introduction </H2>

<P>
This document describes a system for training children
above two years of age to remain motionless
while in a <b> mock </b> functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
scanner. It is <B> NOT </b> in any way compliant
with an actual fMRI, or MRI, scanner.
The system was developed at the University of Colorado,
Boulder, by Niles Oien (nilesOien@gmail.com) in early 2013.
</P>

<P>
This documentation can be accessed with the icon shown below
on the wii system computer after logging in :
</P>

<P align=center>

<P align=center>
 <B> The help icon </b>
</P>

<P>
The system consists of :
<UL>
 <LI> A PC running Ubuntu linux
 <LI> A (very small) bluetooth adapter
 <LI> An early model wiiMote (a remote for the wii gaming system)
 <LI> A system of straps for attaching the wiiMote to a child's head
 <LI> Some custom software running on the PC
</UL>
</P>

<P>
The PC should have had the python scripting language
and the wii library installed on it with the commands :
</P>

<PRE>
sudo apt-get install python
sudo apt-get install libcwiimote-dev python-cwiid python-tk
</PRE>

<P>
Also, the gnome window manager should be installed. The R statistical
package should be installed for data plotting purposes. This has been done
at CU Boulder. The procedures for these installs are extensively
documented on the web.
</P>


<P>
The system operates by "rumbling" (vibrating) the wiiMote (which is strapped
to the child's head) if their motion is determined to be excessive. The sensitivity of the
system can be varied in real time. Also, data from the wiiMote can
be written to a data file during a session.
</P>

<P>
For operations in which motion occurs slowly, such as this,
the wiiMote is fundamentally continually collecting a <b> vector</b>, that is,
detecting the direction
it is currently pointing in. Motion is detected by comparing the current vector
to a reference vector and determining if the difference between the two has
exceeded some angular threshold. The reference vector is initially
taken to be the current vector when the rumble warnings are initially enabled.
After a rumble warning is delivered, the current vector is again taken
to be the reference vector and the process repeats.
</P>

<H2> Initial program operation </H2>

<P>
The program can be started by double clicking on the start icon :
</P>

</P>

<P>
When the program first starts, a data entry window 
similar to the one shown below will appear prompting
the user for the subject's ID and age. The age must be a positive integer,
and the subject ID can be any sequence of characters. Note that <b> both
subject ID and age will be used to name output files</b>, so if subject
anonimity is an issue then the subject's name should not be used as an ID.
</P>

<H2> Bluetooth sync to wiimote </h2>

<P>
After the subject's ID and age are entered, the user will be prompted to
<b> simultaneously press buttons (1) and (2) </b> on the wiiMote
by a pop-up window similar to the one shown below. This will
put the wiiMote into bluetooth <b> discoverable </b> mode so that
a bluetooth connection to the wiiMote can be made.

<H2> Main program operation </h2>

<P>
Once the program is running, it can be driven either via the
wiiMote or via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) on the computer. The buttons
on the wiiMote have the following significance :
</P>

<P align=center>
 <table align=center border=5>
  <tr> <th> wiiMote button </th> <th> Significance </th> </tr>
  <tr> <td> A </td> <td> Accept current pointing vector as the reference </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> + (plus) </td> <td> Turn rumble warnings on </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> - (minus) </td> <td> Turn rumble warnings off </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Home </td> <td> Exit program </td> </tr>
 </table>
</P>

<P align=center>
 <B> wiiMote buttons </b>
</P>


<P>
The GUI (shown below) is very simple. It displays the current
angular tolerance, in degrees, between the
reference vector and the current vector. If this angular tolerance
is exceeded and rumble warnings are enabled, a rumble warning will be delivered. The number
of rumble warnings that have been delivered is also shown. There are also six
clickable buttons, as follows :

 <B> The program GUI </b>
</P>


<P align=center>
 <table align=center border=5>

  <tr> <th> GUI button </th> <th> Significance </th> </tr>

  <tr> <td> Increment angle </td> 
       <td> Increment the allowable angle between the reference
            vector and the current vector (make the system more sensitive). 
            The maximum for this value is 20.0 degrees. It is initially
            set to 10.0 degrees. </td> </tr>

  <tr> <td> Decrement angle </td> 
       <td> Decrement the allowable angle between the reference
            vector and the current vector (make the system more sensitive).
            The minimum for this value is 2.0 degrees which seems to
            be the maximum useful sensitivity of the device. </td> </tr>

  <tr> <td> Turn rumbling on/off </td> 
       <td> Turns rumble warnings on or off. See comments below. </td> </tr>

  <tr> <td> Turn logging on/off </td> 
       <td> Turns data logging - the writing of data to output text files -
            on or off. See the <b> Output data files </b> section.  </td> </tr>


  <tr> <td> Accept current angle </td>
       <td> Take the current pointing vector as the reference angle. </td> </tr>

  <tr> <td> Exit </td> <td> Exit the program  </td> </tr>

 </table>
</P>

<P align=center>
 <B> The GUI buttons </b>
</P>

<P>
When <b> rumble warnings </b> are initially enabled, the current pointing vector is
taken as the reference angle. If the subject's movement subsequently causes the angle between
the current pointing vector and the reference angle to exceed the angular tolerance, then
a rumble warning is delivered to the subject. This consists of the wii "rumbling"
(vibrating) and flashing its LED lights briefly. After the rumble warning, the current
pointing vector is taken as the new reference vector, and the process continues.
</P>


<H2> Output data files </h2>

<P>
When logging is active, data are written to the wiiData/ subdirectory (this directory
is created by the wiiAngle.py script if it does not exist). Files are named
according to the convention <b> YYYYMMDD_hhmmss_ID_age_motion.csv</b>. For instance, data
for an individual identified as <b> John Smith </b> age <b> 46 </b> for whom
the program was run at <b> 11:52:05 on January 18, 2013 </b> would be
written to a file named :
</P>

<PRE>
20130118_115205_John_Smith_46_motion.csv
</PRE>

<P>
These are comma separated variable (CSV) files that can be read into Excel.
They have a non-numerical header line which is followed by numerical data.
The columns in the file are :
</P>

<P align=center>
 <table align=center border=5>
  <tr> <th> Variable </th> <th> Variable type </th> <th> Significance </th> </tr>
  <tr> <td> timeSec </td> <td> floating point </td> <td> Elapsed time, seconds, since program start </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> refX </td> <td> floating point </td>  <td> Reference vector X component </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> refY </td> <td> floating point </td>  <td> Reference vector Y component </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> refZ </td> <td> floating point </td>  <td> Reference vector Z component </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> dataX </td> <td> floating point </td>  <td> Current vector X component </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> dataY </td> <td> floating point </td>  <td> Current vector Y component </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> dataZ </td> <td> floating point </td>  <td> Current vector Z component </td> </tr>

  <tr> <td> angularTolDegrees </td> <td> floating point </td>  
   <td> Maximum angle between current and reference vectors </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> refToDataAngleDegrees </td> <td> floating point </td>  
     <td> Angle between current and reference vectors </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> numRumbles </td> <td> Integer </td>  <td> Number of rumble warnings </td> </tr>

 </table>
</P>

<P align=center>
 <B> Datafile format </b>
</P>

<P>
These files can be converted to a format that allows them to be read
into matlab by removing the non-numerical header line. This can be done
in a text editor, or a command similar to the following one can be
used in a UNIX terminal window, which puts the results from the <b> .csv </b> file
into a similarly named <B> .dat </b> file :
</P>

<PRE>
cat 20130118_115205_John_Smith_46_motion.csv | grep -v timeSec > 20130118_115205_John_Smith_46_motion.dat
</PRE>

<H2> Generating simple data plots </H2>

<P>
Simple plots can be made of the data that were collected by the system
in logging mode. To do this, start a terminal by using the icon below :
</P>

<P align=center>
 <IMG SRC=terminalIcon.png>
</P>

<P align=center>
 <B> The terminal icon </b>
</P>

<P>
Then, enter the following command in the terminal :

<PRE>
cd wii
</PRE>

You only need to give that command once. To see the CSV data files
that are available, use the command :

<PRE>
ls wiiData/*.csv
</PRE>

The available files will be listed. To generate a plot
of the file named :

<PRE>
wiiData/20130123_172029_Niles_Oien_46_motion.csv
</PRE>

Enter the command :

<PRE>
./wiiPlot.R wiiData/20130123_172029_Niles_Oien_46_motion.csv
</PRE>

The output graphic file with the plot will be named similarly, but the
name will end in .png rather than .csv. In this case the graphic file will
be named :

<PRE>
wiiData/20130123_172029_Niles_Oien_46_motion.png
</PRE>

This graphic can be displayed with the command :

<PRE>
display wiiData/20130123_172029_Niles_Oien_46_motion.png
</PRE>


<P align=center>
 <IMG SRC=samplePlot.png>

<P align=center>
 <B> A sample data plot, angle vs. time </b>
</P>


</P>

<H2> Accessing data </H2>

<P>
Probably the best way to access the CSV data files is to use
a USB thumb drive. Insert a thumb drive into a USB port
on the PC. It should appear on the desktop as
an icon.
</P>

<P>
Then,
open the file browser by clicking
on the <b> Places </b> tab at the top left of the desktop
(next to the <B> Applications </b> tab). Open the home folder in
the drop down menu that appears. Then, open the <b> wii </b>
folder by double clicking on it, and then open the <b> wiiData </b>
folder by double clicking on it. The .csv data files any
.png graphic plots that have been generated will appear.
</P>

<P>
Files can then be dragged onto the thumb drive to copy them out of the
system.
</P>

<P>
<B>
When you are done dragging, right click on the thumb drive icon
and select the option to safely remove or eject it
</B>
so that the drive is closed correctly (alternatively the PC can be shut down
with the small icon at the top right of the screen before removing the
thumb drive).
</P>

<P>
To delete a file that is no longer needed (or has been copied elsewhere)
the <b> rm </b> command can be used in a terminal, like this :
</P>

<PRE>
rm wiiData/20130123_172029_Niles_Oien_46_motion.png
</PRE>

<P>
Alternatively, files can be deleted by left clicking on them
in the file browser.
</P>
